    "In this project, we will work with a dataset of used cars from _eBay Kleinanzeigen_, a section of the German eBay website.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The data cleaning and exploring done in this project is not exhaustive and a lot more can be done on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of the cleaning actions took and conlusions made from exploring the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaning actions consisted in:\n",
    "- renaming the columns names to make them more readable on usable\n",
    "- getting rid of the useless descriptors such as the `num_photos`, `seller` and `offer_type` columns\n",
    "- converting the `price` and `odometer` columns to numeric types\n",
    "- renaming the `odometer` column to include the unit\n",
    "- getting rid of the ads featuring an odd price\n",
    "- getting rid of the ads featuring a registration year before 1900 or after the listing year\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploration steps allowed us to get the following insights:\n",
    "- the data were crawled from the website daily over a period of roughly one month\n",
    "- the distribution of ads crawled over this period is uniform\n",
    "- the ads were created over a period of roughly a year\n",
    "- the dataset contains ads of cars from 40 different brands\n",
    "- some brands are more represented than others\n",
    "- among the most represented brands, german brands Audi, Mercedes and BMW feature higher ads prices on average than the others (Volkswagen, Opel and ford)\n",
    "- the average mileage difference between these brands doesn't reflect this price difference\n",
    "- the price difference may be explained by the reknown quality and longevity of german cars\n",

    "- converting the `price` and `odometer` columns to numeric types\n",

    "- the data were crawled from the website daily over a period of roughly one month\n",

    "- the ads were created over a period of roughly a year\n",
    "- the dataset contains ads of cars from 40 different brands\n",
    "- some brands are more represented than others\n",
    "- among the most represented brands, german brands Audi, Mercedes and BMW feature higher ads prices on average than the others (Volkswagen, Opel and ford)\n",
    "- the average mileage difference between these brands doesn't reflect this price difference\n",
    "- the price difference may be explained by the reknown quality and longevity of german cars"
